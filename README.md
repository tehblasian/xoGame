# xoGame
An in-console TicTacToe game coded in Java.
To make a move, enter the coordinates (row & column) of the desired square (i.e. to play the top-right square, enter "00" -- no spaces).
Supports local multiplayer.
Single-player mode pits you against a computer that is impossible to beat*.

*Currently, the AI uses the minimax algorithm to play the most optimal move available. Therefore, it will always draw or win if the user makes a wrong move. I am working on properly adding levels of difficulty to the AI.

Will eventually learn basic graphics and make a GUI so that a move can be made by simply clicking on the desired space.
